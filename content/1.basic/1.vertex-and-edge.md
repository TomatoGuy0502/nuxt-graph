# 1. Vertex and Edge

## Introduction

In Graph Theory, a graph consists of **vertices** (also known as nodes) and **edges**. Each vertex, represents a unique entity or object. Each edge, represents the connections between these vertices, define the relationships and interactions between them.

In the interactive area on the right, **vertices** will be represented by dots and **edges** by lines.
::

Two vertices are said to be **neighbors** or **adjacent** if they are connected by an edge.

The **order** of a graph is the number of its vertices, while the **size** is the number of its edges. These together offer fundamental information about the scale and interconnectedness of a graph.

::content-help
A little confused? The first letter in **order** looks like a circle, so **order** is the number of vertices. Easy to remember, right?

## Exercise

::content-alert
To see how to interact with the graph, hover :content-how-to-button at top-right corner.
::

1. Try to edit the graph so that there are 4 vertices and 4 edges
2. Now try to make it order 5 and size 7
