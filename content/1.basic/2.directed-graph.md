# Directed Graph

## Introduction
A **Directed Graph** or **Digraph** is composed of vertices and directed edges. Each directed edge has a start vertex and an end vertex. The edge is said to point from the start to the end.

**Directed graphs**  can represent one-way relationships. On social media like Twitter or Instagram, if user A follows user B, this can be represented as a directed edge from A to B.
