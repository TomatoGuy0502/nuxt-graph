# 2. Weighted Graph

## Introduction
In a **weighted graph**, each edge is assigned a numerical value or weight. These weights can represent various properties such as distances, costs, or strengths associated with the connections between vertices. 

Weighted graphs are used to model situations where the intensity or significance of relationships between vertices varies. They find applications in optimization problems where the weights provide additional information for evaluating and analyzing the graph structure.

In the interactive area, the **weight** of each edge is displayed on the edge and will be randomly generated.

## Exercise
1. Try to add 5 more edges to the graph
