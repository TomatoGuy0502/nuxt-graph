# 3. Degree of Vertex

## Introduction

The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges that are connected with it (or number of neighbours). This measure gives a sense of the 'connectivity' of a vertex within the graph.

In a directed graph, we differentiate between the **in-degree** (number of incoming edges) and the **out-degree** (number of outgoing edges).

A **Complete Graph** is a special kind of graph where every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex, resulting in the maximum possible number of edges for a given number of vertices.

::content-help
An undirected **Complete Graph** with order n, it's graph size equals n * (n - 1) / 2.

::content-help
A directed **Complete Graph** with order n, it's graph size equals n * (n - 1).

## Exercise

::content-alert
You can toggle between directed and undirected graph by the switch
::

::content-alert
Hover on vertex to see its **in-degree** and **out-degree** when it is a directed graph

::content-exercise{:number-of-exercises=3}
#exercise-1
Try to edit the undirected graph so that there are only 4 vertices, and the degree of each vertex is 3, 2, 2, 1

#exercise-2
Try to create an undirected complete graph with 4 vertices

#exercise-3
Try to make a directed graph that has 5 vertices, and there is a vertex has in-degree 4 and out-degree 2 (so that it has degree 6)
