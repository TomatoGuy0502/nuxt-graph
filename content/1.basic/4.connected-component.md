# 4. Connected Component

## Introduction
A graph can be called **connected** if and only if any vertex in the graph can be reached from any other vertex in the graph. In other words, for any two vertices u and v, there is a path connecting them.

A graph is said to be **disconnected** if it does not satisfy the above condition, i.e. if there are at least two vertices that cannot be reached by a path to each other

A **connected component** is an "island" where each vertex within the component is accessible from every other vertex in the same component, but not from any vertex outside it.

::content-help
If the graph is connected, then it has only one connected component.
::

::content-alert
Each connected component is represented by a different color in the interactive area.

## Exercise

1. Edit the graph so that it is connected
2. Try to edit the graph so that it has 3 connected components
