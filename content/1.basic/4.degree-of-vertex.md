# 4. Degree of Vertex

## Introduction

The **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges that are connected with it (or number of neighbours). This measure gives a sense of the 'connectivity' of a vertex within the graph.

In a directed graph, we differentiate between the **in-degree** (number of incoming edges) and the **out-degree** (number of outgoing edges).

## Exercise

::content-alert
You can toggle between directed and undirected graph by the switch
::

::content-alert
Hover on vertex to see its **in-degree** and **out-degree** when it is a directed graph
::

1. Try to edit the undirected graph so that there are only 4 vertices, and the degree of each vertex is 3, 2, 2, 1
2. Try to make a directed graph that has 5 vertices, and there is a vertex has in-degree 4 and out-degree 2 (so that it has degree 6)
