# 6. Weighted Graph

## Introduction
In a **weighted graph**, each edge is assigned a numerical value or weight. These weights can represent various properties such as distances, costs, or strengths associated with the connections between vertices. 

**Weighted graphs** are used to model situations where the intensity or significance of relationships between vertices varies. They find applications in optimization problems, network analysis, and decision-making processes where the weights provide additional information for evaluating and analyzing the graph structure.

## Exercise
::content-alert
In the interactive area, the **weight** will be randomly generated.
::
1. Try to add 5 more edges to the graph
