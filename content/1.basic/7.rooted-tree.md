# 7. Rooted Tree

## Introduction

A **rooted tree** is a special type of tree. It is a hierarchical structure consisting of vertices and edges, with a unique **root** vertex from which all other vertices are accessible. The node without any children is called a **leaf**.

::content-help
Think it as a tree in nature consists of a central trunk with branches extending outward
::

The term **depth** (or **level**) refers to the distance of a particular node from the root. It measures the number of edges traversed from the root to reach that specific node. The root node itself has a depth of 0, and each subsequent level increases the depth by 1.

::content-alert
Hover over the vertices to see their **depth**.
::

On the other hand, the **height** of a rooted tree is the maximum depth of any node in the tree. It is the length of the longest path from the a leaf to root.

## Exercise

::content-alert
In the interactive area, **root** can't be moved or removed.
::
::content-alert
Click on the vertices to add a child.
::
1. Edit the graph so that it is a rooted tree with height 4
2. Try to make it with 6 leaves
