# 7. Tree and Forest

## Introduction

A **tree** is a special type of undirected graph that is connected and acyclic, meaning it has no cycles or loops.

A **forest** is a collection of trees, i.e. a graph that is acyclic but not necessarily connected.

::content-help
Note that a tree is still a forest, but a forest is not necessarily a tree.
