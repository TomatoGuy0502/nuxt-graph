# Tree and Forest

## Introduction

A **tree** is a special type of undirected graph that is connected and acyclic, meaning it has no cycles or loops.

A **forest** is a collection of trees, i.e. a graph that is acyclic but not necessarily connected.

Note that a tree is still a forest, but a forest is not necessarily a tree.

## Exercise

1. Try to edit the graph so that it is a tree
2. Try to make it a forest with 3 trees
3. Try to make a cycle in the graph, is the graph still a forest?
