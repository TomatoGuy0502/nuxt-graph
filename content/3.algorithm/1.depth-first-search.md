# Depth-First Search

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used to explore or search through a graph. It starts at a given vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## Algorithm

The DFS algorithm can be implemented using a stack or recursion. Here is a basic outline of the algorithm:

1. Choose a starting vertex and mark it as visited.
2. Visit the vertex and process it.
3. For each unvisited neighbor of the current vertex, recursively apply the DFS algorithm.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all vertices have been visited.

## Applications

DFS has various applications in graph theory and computer science. Some common uses include:

- Finding connected components in a graph.
- Detecting cycles in a graph.
- Topological sorting.
- Generating spanning trees.

## Example

Let's consider a simple example of DFS in action. Suppose we have the following graph:
```
    A
   / \
  B    C
 / \    \
D   E    F
```
Starting from vertex A, the DFS traversal would visit vertices in the following order: A, B, D, E, C, F. It explores each branch as far as possible before backtracking.

## Conclusion

DFS is a powerful algorithm for exploring graphs and solving various graph-related problems. By traversing the graph in a depth-first manner, it allows us to efficiently search for specific nodes, find connected components, detect cycles, and more.
