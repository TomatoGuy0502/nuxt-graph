# 2. Breadth-First Search

## Introduction

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore or search through a graph in a breadthward motion. It starts at a given vertex and explores all its neighbors before moving on to the next level of vertices. It has various applications. For example, it can be used to determining connectivity in a graph or to find the shortest path between two vertices.

## Algorithm

The BFS algorithm can be implemented using a queue. Here is a basic outline of the algorithm:

::content-help
A queue is a data structure that follows the principle of "first-in, first-out" (FIFO), where elements are added to the end and removed from the front.
::

1. Choose a starting vertex and enqueue it.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a vertex and mark it as visited.
3. Enqueue all the unvisited neighbors of the dequeued vertex.
4. Repeat steps 2 to 3 until the queue is empty.

## Exercise
1. Run BFS algorithm starting at vertex 0 with Auto Play.
2. Change the starting vertex to 3 and run the algorithm manually (by clicking First Step).
3. Try to make a graph with 5 vertices and any number of edges. Choose a starting vertex and calculate the traversal order using BFS without looking at the result. Then, run the algorithm to check your answer.
